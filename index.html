      		<h3>black rebel motorcycle club</h3>
      		<p>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (BRMC) is an American rock band from San Francisco, California. The band name speaks for itself perfectly hinting that their music is all about heavy garage rock'n'roll and rebelious adventures... and those ho relate to this mood.</p>

			<h3>jimi hendrix</h3>
      		<p>Psychedelic sounds of Johnny Allen Hendrix, more famous as Jimi Hendrix, and his inarguably extraordinary talent in guitar playing techniques made him a reputation of "the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music." His live at Woodstock 1969 still remains one of the most legendary rock performances ever known.</p>

   			<h3>Graveyard</h3>
   			<p>Members of Swedish band Graveyard have gone a long and difficult way in finding their unique voice in music industry, falling in and out of various projects and bands. Eventually they established themselves as pure psychedelic blues rock band. Joakim Nillson's harsh but melancolic timbre creates a stongly appealing character, and throws the listener into a billowy ocean of emotions.</p>

  			<h3>Radiohead</h3>
  			<p> Starting as English Rock band in 1985, Radiohead eventually became one of the most popular rock bands in our century. The first stone to their wall of fame was set by their single album "Creep" - still one of the most loved rock pieces ever written. Perhaps their success lies in the theme they chose - modern alienation - a problem so strongly rooted in contemporary society, and extraordinarily tender and multifaceted lyrics.</p>

 			<h3>Darkside</h3>
 			<p>The collaboration of multi-instrumentalist Dave Harrington and electronic musician Nicolas Jaar grants us with low'n'deep music which manages to also be sort of cloudy-light and dreamy. Their first songs were written almost accidentally while on tour in Berlin for their other project.</p>

  			<h3>Gesaffelstein</h3>
  			<p>Mike Levy, more famous as Gesaffelstein is a French techno artist and DJ. Alongside with his mixes of hundreds of popular songs, his debut album rose him to the next level. At first it's easy to get lost in the noisiness of some tracks, like Obsession, but then you learn how to pull out the deeper sounds from the bottom of the tracks.</p>
